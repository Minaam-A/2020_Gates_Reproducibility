##### If you don't have R and RStudio installed

* Download R from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).
* Select the `.pkg` file for the latest R version
* Double click on the downloaded file to install R
* It is also a good idea to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (needed
  by some packages)
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)**
  (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install RStudio
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.
