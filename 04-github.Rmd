## Using GitHub from RStudio

Although you can do more or less all the version control aspects via the GitHub website, this is not very convenient when you are working on your R projects. Now you have an idea of how the GitHub workflow works, we can start to integrate these version control concepts with RStudio.

\

### Linking Git and RStudio

To use Git from within RStudio you need to make sure that Git can be found by RStudio.

If you haven't done so already, make sure to go to: `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Git/SVN` and check that 'Enable version control interface for RStudio projects` is enabled. Also, check that the path to Git is present and correct.

```{r git_options, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_options_rstudio.png")
```

You also need to inform Git of your name and e-mail address so that it can label the commits with these details. To do this, go to `Tools` > `Shell` and provide the following details:

```
git config --global user.name "yourGitHubUsername"
git config --global user.email "name@provider.com"
```

You can verify that these are set up properly by running `git config --global --list` in the shell.

### Starting a new project under Git control

If you want version control of your R project, you need to make sure that the project is under control of Git.

The easiest way to start this is by creating a **new project** that is **linked to an existing GitHub repository**.

We can link a new project to the GitHub repository that we generated previously. To do this, we need to copy the URL for this repository. To do this, you have to go to the repository page and click on the `Clone or download` button. You can then copy the URL as shown below:

```{r git_rstudio_01, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_rstudio_01.png")
```

Next, we need to create a new project. Go to `File` > `New Project` > `Version Control` > `Git`.

```{r git_rstudio_02, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_rstudio_02.png")
```

```{r git_rstudio_03, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_rstudio_03.png")
```

In `Repository URL` paste the link to your GitHub repository.
Give the project a name (avoid spaces and try to use a meaningful name) and tell RStudio where to save it.
It is useful to tick the `Open in a new session` box, so that your project opens in a new RStudio session. That way RStudio opens a session with a clean environment.

```{r git_rstudio_04, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_rstudio_04.png")
```

Your project will open and your RStudio session should now have an extra tab in the top right corner (where your Environment is), named `Git`. This is where all the changes will show up as you work on your project.

```{r git_rstudio_05, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_rstudio_05.png")
```

These options can also be found by using the
```{r git_toolbar_button, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_toolbar_button.png")
``` 
button in the toolbar. When you have opened a file and look at the options under this button it also enables you to find differences from the last commit (if there are any) or view the commit history of that file.

```{r git_rstudio_06, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_rstudio_06.png")
```

\

### Changes and your remote repository

Let's make some changes to our local repository, which is now under Git control. Here we are first creating a folder called `notebooks` and adding an R Markdown file named `01_import_and_clean_data.Rmd`.

Once you have created the file you'll see the folder appearing in the `Git` tab. When you tick the `Staged` box, the  `Status` changes to Added. This means that Git is tracking your file and will include it in the next commit.

```{r git_rstudio_untracked, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_rstudio_untracked_changes.png")
```

```{r git_rstudio_tracked, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_rstudio_tracked_changes.png")
```

There are a few other icons that can appear in the Git pane, so here is an overview:

*
```{r results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_untracked_button.png")
```
, **untracked** file. Git has not seen this before and it needs to be added before changes are tracked.
*
```{r results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_added_button.png")
```
, **added** file. The file is now tracked by Git.
*
```{r results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_modified_button.png")
```
, **modified** file. The file has been modified since the last commit.
*
```{r results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_deleted_button.png")
```
, **deleted** file. The file has been deleted since the last commit.

When we edit the file a bit we can see how it changed by clicking on the `Diff` button in the `Git` toolbar.

```{r git_rstudio_differences, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_rstudio_diff.png")
```

If we are happy with the changes then we can commit them. You can do this by pressing the `Commit` button in the `Git` tab and adding a commit message. All the files that are staged will be included in that particular commit. If there are files that you do not want to commit yet then you can untick them before pressing the `Commit` button.

```{r git_rstudio_commit, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_rstudio_commit.png")
```

To ensure that the changes end up on your remote repository you need to **push** the changes. To do this, press the `Push` button in the top right corner. RStudio will give you a message that the changes are pushed:

```{r git_rstudio_push, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_rstudio_push.png")
```

> ### Challenge 1 - Version control in RStudio
>
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Create a new R Project under version control
3. Link the R Project with the remote repository

\

> ### Challenge 2 - Branching and changes
>
1. Create a new branch (e.g. `new_notebook`) from within RStudio. To do this, use the following button in the `Git` pane:
```{r new_branch_button, results='markup', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new_branch_button.png")
```
2. Create a `notebooks` folder and save a new R Markdown file in it.
3. Ensure that changes to the new file are tracked.
4. Make some changes to the file and commit them.
5. Push the changes to the remote repository.

\

> ### Challenge 3 - Pull requests
>
1. Go to your GitHub repository and navigate to the newly created branch
2. Create a pull request
3. Merge the pull request with the `master` branch
4. Congratulate yourself on being a version control Pro!

## Forking projects

So far we have used repositories that we created ourselves. But you might find that you want to add to somebody else's project. Or you like their project and want to adapt it to your needs. In that case you need to make a personal copy of that project. This is called **forking**.

Once you have forked a repository to your GitHub account you can make changes to it. Good practice is to create a **new branch** in your copy of the repository, so that you do not run the risk of confusing the `master` branch of your copy with the `master` branch of the original repository.

After you have created a new branch on your forked copy you can start editing/adding as you like. You do this as you have done before, by **staging** and **committing** changes to your repository.

When you want to suggest incorporating some of these changes into the original repository you will have to open a **pull request**. This works in the same way is described in the [pull requests](#pull-requests) section, but instead of comparing two branches on the same repository, you are comparing the branch on your forked copy with the `master` branch of the original repository.
